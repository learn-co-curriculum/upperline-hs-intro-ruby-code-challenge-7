##Today's Code Challenge!

Today, you're freelancing for Spotify. Your goal is to build out their `User` class. A user should have a username, password, email, liked_songs, liked_artists, and playlists attributes.

The email, password, and username attributes should be passed during initialization. A user's account should initialize with no liked_artists or liked_songs, and an empty playlist.

A user should be able to create a playlist and add songs to their playlist. A user should also be able to like a song or an artist.
